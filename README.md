# SkillForge
A Campus-First Peer Skill Marketplace

"Every student has a skill. Nobody gives them a chance to prove it — until now."

SkillForge is a closed-campus, peer-to-peer (P2P) skill exchange platform built exclusively for college students. It breaks the "no experience, no work" cycle by creating a high-trust, credit-based environment where a student's college identity acts as their primary credential.

🚀 Vision
Traditional freelance platforms require experience before getting work. SkillForge flips that model by creating a safe campus ecosystem where students can:

Work on real projects inside their campus community
Build a verifiable portfolio
Earn a campus reputation score
Exchange services through an internal credit economy
This removes payment friction and focuses on learning, collaboration, and real experience.

📦 Core Features (MVP)
1. Campus-Only Authentication
Only students with approved college email domains can register.

2. Dual User Roles
Users can switch between:

Worker → Offers skills and completes projects
Client → Posts tasks and hires other students
3. Credit Economy
Each user receives 100 credits on signup
Credits transfer only after project approval
Prevents payment issues while encouraging fair exchange
4. Skill Categories
Platform supports multiple student skill categories including:

Graphic Design
Web Development
Content Writing
AI Data Tasks
Video Editing
Presentation Design
Research Assistance
5. Managed Project Workflow
Projects go through admin approval to maintain quality and prevent spam.

6. Auto Portfolio System
Every completed project automatically appears in the student's public portfolio profile.
